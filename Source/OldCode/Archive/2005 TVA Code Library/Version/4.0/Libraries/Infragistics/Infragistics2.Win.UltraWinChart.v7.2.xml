            <remarks>
            <p class="body">
            A custom object implementing IAnnotation can be added to
            an UltraChart's Annotations collection, and thus be
            rendered on a chart like any other type of annotation
            object.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
            Alternatively, an IAnnotation object's RenderAnnotation method can be
            called from a custom layer, which would cause it to be
            rendered to the SceneGraph using the specified parameters
            for location.

            This overload of the RenderAnnotation method will be called by the Annotation Layer when an annotation's Location
            has matched with a parent primitive.  For example, if the annotation's Row and Column
            are the same as another primitive's, a parent primitive has been found for the annotation,

            If multiple parent matches have been found for a single annotation, for example if the annotation

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Ensure this property has been set to True or this chart text label will not be displayed.  Other reasons why chart text labels may not appear on a chart include:</p>
            <ll>
            <ul>This <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance"/> object may not have been added to the <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextCollection"/> property (named ChartText) of the correct chart control.</ul>
            <ul>The values assigned to <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.Row"/> and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.Column"/> do not identify a graphical chart element, or these identify a graphical chart element outside the current viewport (due to scaling and/or scrolling.)</ul>
            <ul>Setting <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.HorizontalAlign"/> (often on bar charts) or <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.VerticalAlign"/> (often on column charts) to an inappropriate alignment.  When the underlying bar or column comes into contact with a near or far axis, rendering the label could cause it to appear outside the grid (region between axes).  In these cases the label will be clipped, and the appropriate alignment property should be adjusted to make the chart text label visible.</ul>
            <ul>When the format string set in <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.ItemFormatString"/> is unrecognized or does not apply to the current chart type, a partial or empty label may render.  For instance, applying the &lt;DATA_VALUE_Z&gt; keyword that is applicable in a bubble chart context to chart text appearing on a two-dimensional line chart (having only X and Y data values) will cause an empty string to be rendered.</ul>
            <ul>A chart text label may be temporarily concealed by highlighting if the label appears inside a graphical element and the highlight is opaque.</ul>
            <ul>The <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.FontColor"/> is the same, or close to, the background color of the chart.</ul>
            </ll>
            <p class="body">Multiple ChartTextAppearance objects can apply to the same graphical chart element (identified by the same ( <i>row</i>, <i>column</i>)) and be alternated by toggling their Visible properties such that only one piece of chart text is displayed at once.</p>

            <p class="body">The DataAppearance class manages the appearance of the data in the chart, including it's filtering (even if the application doesn't already take advantage of the filtering capabilities of the DataView class).</p>
            <p class="body">The primary purpose of this Appearance object that all developers need to be comfortable with is using the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.DataSource"/> property and <see cref="M:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.DataBind"/> method to set the data source and initiate binding to that data source.  Data sources that support the Framework's IBindingList interface (this includes data tables) support live updates to the chart reflecting changes within the data.</p>
            <p class="body">Additional filter support in DataAppearance includes whether the chart should be Zero-aligned to a linear, numeric axis (see the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.ZeroAligned"/> property), exclusive limits that establish a band of data that should be presented (see the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.MinValue"/>, <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.MaxValue"/> and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.UseMinMax"/> properties), and whether the rows and columns in the data source should be transposed prior to charting (see the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.SwapRowsAndColumns"/> property).</p>

            <p class="body">XML documents require an internal XML Schema document, and must be readily mappable to the Framework's DataSet (their <b>msdata:IsDataSet</b> attribute is set to <i>true</i>).  The schema is also necessary since each XML element must be strongly-typed (otherwise their data type will be inferred as <b>xsd:string</b> and this will not translate readily into a DataSet, even though the data content of the element may be numeric.)  Please see Generating DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema in the .NET Framework documentation for more on the issues involved, and consult the samples included with this product for working schema.</p>

When there is little variation between data values (<i>i.e.</i>, the difference between the maximum and minimum values being charted is small compared to the minimum value's difference from the zero-axis), it is a better choice to adjust the RangeAxisType to Custom on the <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance"/> and set the RangeMin and RangeMax properties instead of using zero-alignment.</p>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">This method allows application logic to drill back up the chart, refreshing the chart with the information and presentation of the parent chart.  The effects of calling DrillBack() or using the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.ShowButton"/> property is identical.</p>
            <p class="body">Developers may call DrillBack() repeatedly in a loop, until the method returns <b>false</b>, to quickly ascend to the topmost chart in the drill down hierarchy from any child chart.  When doing so, it is advisable to first set UltraChart's Visible property to false to prevent screen flicker as chart type may change in the process of drilling back to the topmost chart from great depth.</p>
            </remarks>
            <returns>True if the user drilled back up one level, false otherwise (the user must already be at the topmost chart in the drill down hierarchy).</returns>

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Set the DrillElements property to a non-null, non-empty array to define the drill down hierarchy (the tree-like structure of parent and child charts descendant from one top-level chart).  Each DrillElement object in this array should be initialized prior to the user interacting with the Chart, so it's advisable that this property be initialized in Form or Page load events.</p>
            <p class="body">The drill down hierarchy contains nodes describing the necessary properties of child charts descendent from one topmost chart (the chart appearing when UltraChart is first databound and displayed before any drill down has occured).</p>
            <p class="body">The consequences of changing DrillElement objects in this collection once the user has interacted with the drill down hierarchy are undefined.  If you must make changes to the structure of the drill down hierarchy, return the user to the topmost chart.</p>

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Enables drill down functionality in UltraChart.
            Before drill down can be fully realized, the DrillElement property must
            be initialized with an array of DrillElements that describe the drill
            down hierarchy.</p>
            <p class="body">For all WebCharts and WinCharts with custom Drill Down (IDrillDown) implemented,
            this property will have no effect.  To disable Drill Down in a custom IDrillDown implementation,

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">This property affects WinChart and not WebChart.  The drill back button is not available in WebChart.</p>
            <p class="body">When active, a drill back button is automatically displayed at the top-left corner of the chart grid (it may appear outside of Pie and Doughnut charts since they have no upper-right corner).  It appears behind graphed objects when those objects are highlighted.  It isn't possible to relocate this button, and it is not shown by default.</p>
            <p class="body">As an alternative to using ShowButton, developers can provide their own Button or user interface experience to control drill back.  The UltraChart class exposes a DrillBack() method that can be called by application logic (such as in an ClickEvent handler).</p> 
            <p class="body">Whether the user navigates up the drill down hierarchy using the provided button or an application generated DrillBack() call, the effect of returning to the parent chart is the same.  Since this button does not appear, it is incumbent upon developers to either turn on ShowButton or provide their own DrillBack() call to enable users to revisit parent charts.</p>

            <p class="body">This property returns the depth (or "drilled level") in the drill down hierarchy of the currently displayed child chart.  Each time a user drills down, depth (their distance from the topmost chart) increases by one level.  Calling the <see cref="M:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.DrillBack"/>() method or using the drill back button (see the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.ShowButton"/> property), both reduce the depth by one level.</p>
            <p class="body">Depth is read-only. It cannot be directly modified to skip several levels in the drill down hierarchy.  It is possible to have multiple <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.DrillElement"/> objects refer to equivalent child charts (identical <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Shared.Styles.ChartType"/>s and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.DataSource">DataSource</see>s), even at different depths in the drill down hierarchy, thereby simulating the appearance of diving several levels at once.</p>

            An Appearance object describing the style for Axis Gridlines (major and minor).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Gridlines come in two types: major and minor.  They appear alternating in two-dimensional chart grids by default, based on the major and minor tickmark intervals.  Developers should design the style of minor gridlines to be more subtle than that applied to major gridlines, if minor gridlines are used at all.  Each <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance"/> is associated with a pair of GridlinesAppearance objects.</p>
            <p class="body">Gridlines automatically scroll and scale in conjunction with the current scrollbar position, and usually have a fixed correspondence to axis labels, if labels appear.  Labels may not always correspond to gridlines if custom keywords are used and some tickmarks are therefore not labeled by a charting application's design.</p>
            <p class="body">Gridlines are always rendered perpendicular to their parent axis.</p>
            <p class="body">This appearance object only supports the customizability of 2-D Charts' gridlines.</p>

            <p class="body">Changing this value at run-time can cause the Chart grid to expand to take up the portion of space within the control that was previous reserved by <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.LegendAppearance.SpanPercentage"/> for the Legend box.  To overcome this side effect of hiding a Legend Box, developers may wish to use the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance.Extent">Extent</see> property of an adjacent Axis to reserve an amount of space equivalent to that reserved for the Legend were it visible.

            <p class="body">This is a percentage value that must be between 0 and 100.  The developer is responsible for setting a value appropriate to display a presentable chart.  Large values for SpanPercentage tend to make the Legend box appear larger than the chart, and can make the chart unreadable.  Very small values for SpanPercentage may make the Legend box unreadable.</p>
            <p class="body">The dimension spanned by the Legend box is the width of the chart control area (when <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.LegendAppearance.Location"/> is set to Left or Right) or its height (when Location is set to either Top or Bottom).

            <p class="body">The Format can be used to diplay labels in a predefined format (most commonly used for item labeling or data value labeling), or in a custom format (specifying formatting of data values or through custom keywords).  When Format is set to Custom, the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.PieLabelAppearance.FormatString"/> is used to determine the format in which the labels are displayed.  It is important to employ the Custom format even when using standard keywords such as &lt;DATA_VALUE&gt; if a customized format string or 'picture' is used (for instance, &lt;DATA_VALUE:#0.00&gt;).</p>

Connecting lines can also be subject to smoothing through spline fitting with the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.LineAppearance">LineAppearance</see> property.</p>
            <p class="body">There are a variety of symbols that can be used to plot scatter points, including shapes and Unicode glyphs.  These symboles can be grouped by series when developers configure an additional data column in <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.GroupByColumn"/> that relates scatter point tuples of the same series.  See the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.Icon"/> and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.Character"/> properties for more details on the selection of symbols.</p>

            <p class="body">Striplines are narrow rectangular bands or "stripes" that appear at a periodic interval behind graphic chart elements.  Strip lines can be used on any 2-D axis where grouping occurs, such as the X-axis of a column chart or the Y-axis of a bar or Gantt chart.</p>
            <p class="body">Developers can activate striplines on a <i>single axis</i> by retrieving the appropriate <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance"/> object and setting the StripLines <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.StripLineAppearance.Visible"/> property to True.  The effect of turning on striplines for multiple axes is undefined.</p>
            <p class="body">Strip lines will be orthogonal to their parent axis, and appear behind every <i>N</i>th data element as specified by the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.StripLineAppearance.Interval"/> property.</p>

            An Appearance object controlling the user's perspective on 3-D charts.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Developers can set properties on this Appearance object at design-time or run-time to alter the vantage point a user has when examining a three-dimensional chart, including specifying the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.XRotation"/>, <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.YRotation"/> and/or <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.ZRotation"/> around each of the three axes.</p>
            <p class="body">Three-dimensional charts are displayed in a 3-D chart grid area, with XY, XZ and YZ backplanes and a clear frontal view.  Using this class, developers may rotate a chart such that the user is looking at it through a backplane (ie, from behind or underneath the chart grid).  The result of such viewing angles are undefined.  Instead of rotating behind the chart grid, developers should re-orient the data plotted in the 3-D chart to bring background elements to the front for the user to examine.</p>
            <p class="body">End users may rotate and revolve charts (in UltraWinChart only) at run-time by holding down the ALT-key on the keyboard and dragging the mouse.  Developers can disable this by intercepting and terminating mouse events when the ALT-key is depressed.</p>

            <p class="body">For these purposes, developers will find it necessary to set (at minimum) the DrillElement's ID property (identifying what data element on a parent chart will be drillable), its Data source (identifying where information comes from to populate the child chart drilled to), and the chart type (of the child chart).</p>

            <p class="body">A gradient is a blend of color beginning at the principle color for this graphical object, specified by the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.PaintElement.Fill">Fill</see> property, and then smoothly interpolating into the color specified by the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.PaintElement.FillStopColor">FillStopColor</see> property.

            <p class="body">The control supports a variety of data source types.</p>
            <p class="body">The most robust and extensible data source is the DataTable, which provides update notifications via the IBindingList interface.  Use of these built-in ADO.NET data management types offers the greatest flexibility.</p>
            <p class="body">Many charts also support data-binding to ICollections (including simple arrays) provided the a single-typed, one-dimensional array can meet the chart type's Data Requirements.  Chartable data sources include custom ICollections, and custom data objects that additionally support IBindingList may take advantage of live data-binding to the chart component.</p>
            <p class="body">Another data source that may be provided is the local filename of an XML or comma-delimited text file.</p>
            <p class="body">XML documents require an internal XML Schema document, and must be readily mappable to the Framework's DataSet (their <b>msdata:IsDataSet</b> attribute is set to <i>true</i>).  The schema is also necessary since each XML element must be strongly-typed (otherwise their data type will be inferred as <b>xsd:string</b> and this will not translate readily into a DataSet, even though the data content of the element may be numeric.)  Please see the "Generating DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema" document in the .NET Framework documentation for more on the issues involved, and consult the samples included with this product for working schema.</p>
            <p class="body">Data may be unbound from a chart by calling the <see cref="M:Infragistics.Win.UltraWinChart.UltraChart.ResetDataSource"/> method.</p>
