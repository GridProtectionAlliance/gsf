# Grid Solutions Framework

The Grid Solutions Framework (GSF) is an extensive open source collection of .NET code used by electric power utilities and various open source projects. GSF contains a large variety of code useful for any .NET project consisting of hundreds of class libraries that extend or expand the functionality included in the .NET Framework with a focus on tools and protocol parsers that are useful for the electric power industry.

The Grid Solutions Framework, administered by the [Grid Protection Alliance](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/) (GPA), is a combination of the existing Time Series Framework and TVA Code Library projects that were hosted on CodePlex.  In creating the GSF, new code components have been added and the libraries have been refactored to make this integrated framework more secure and significantly better performing.

The [open Phasor Data Concentrator](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openPDC) (openPDC), [Secure Information Exchange Gateway](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/SIEGate) (SIEGate) and [open Historian](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openHistorian) are examples of projects that use the Grid Solutions Framework.
